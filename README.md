# Exploring London's Travel Network
###### In this project, I worked with an *Amazon Redshift* database containing data on journeys and transport types in London between 2010 and 2022. I wrote SQL queries to discover the most popular transport methods and examined periods of high activity for the Emirates Airline cable car, which connects London's Royal Docks (where the Mayor's office is located) to Greenwich Peninsula (home of the O2 arena), and identified rare instances when the Underground (referred to as "the tube" by locals) experienced lower levels of activity.
## Instructions
###### Write three SQL queries to answer the following questions:
###### 1. What are the most popular transport types, measured by the total number of journeys? The output should contain two columns, 1) *journey_type* and 2) *total_journeys_millions*, and be sorted by the second column in **descending order**. Save the query as *most_popular_transport_types*.
###### 2. Which five months and years were the most popular for the Emirates Airline? Return an output containing *month*, *year*, and *journeys_millions*, with the latter rounded to two decimal places and aliased as *rounded_journeys_millions*. Exclude null values and order the results by 1) *rounded_journeys_millions* in descending order and 2) *year* in ascending order, saving the result as emirates_airline_popularity.
###### 3. Find the five years with the lowest volume of Underground & DLR journeys, saving as *least_popular_years_tube*. The results should contain the columns *year*, *journey_type*, and *total_journeys_millions*.
